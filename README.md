# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project
This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 data using the dataset from Our World in Data. The dataset provides comprehensive information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, testing, and vaccinations across various countries and continents.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project was obtained from Our World in Data. It includes information on COVID-19 deaths, such as the date, location, total cases, new cases, total deaths, and population.

# SQL Queries
The project utilizes SQL queries to analyze the COVID-19 data. Here is an overview of the main queries used in the analysis:

# Selecting COVID-19 deaths data for countries with a specified continent.
Data cleaning, including handling null values and converting date formats.
Analyzing total cases vs. total deaths, providing insights into the chances of death if affected in a specific country.
Analyzing total cases vs. population, showing the percentage of the population infected with COVID-19.
Identifying countries with the highest infection rates relative to population.
Identifying countries with the highest death rates.
Analyzing death rates by continent.
Obtaining worldwide COVID-19 statistics.
Analyzing total population vs. vaccinations, examining the correlation between population and vaccination rates.
# How to Use
To run these SQL queries and perform your own analysis:
Make sure you have a SQL database management system installed (I used Microsoft SQL Server).
Create a database and import the COVID-19 deaths and vaccination datasets.
Modify the table and column names in the queries to match your database structure.
Execute the SQL queries in the provided order to obtain the desired analysis results.
Feel free to customize the queries or add new ones according to your specific requirements.

# Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the COVID-19 pandemic by analyzing the available dataset. The SQL queries allow you to explore trends, patterns, and correlations related to COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations. I further created dashboard based on the data on tableau.
